# DataOnQ
DataOnQ is a new and exciting way to handle offline data capabilities in .NET projects such as Xamarin, Uno, UWP and anything in the ecosystem. The FileOnQ Development team has built this library originally designed for interal project use and is starting the process of converting the library to an Open Source Project.
